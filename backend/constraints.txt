# Hard constraints to prevent pip from upgrading torch to CUDA builds on Railway.
# We want CPU-only wheels to keep image size + build times reasonable.
#
# IMPORTANT:
# - Pin torch to a CPU-only build (+cpu) to avoid massive CUDA downloads.
# - Pin transformers/sentence-transformers to versions compatible with this torch API.
torch==2.2.2+cpu

# Keep the embeddings stack stable (avoid torch/transformers API mismatches)
transformers==4.39.3
sentence-transformers==2.7.0
