This guide walks you through signing up and processing your first video with Video Recap AI.

## Step 1: Create an Account

1. Go to [www.videorecapai.com](https://www.videorecapai.com) and click **Get Started**
2. Sign in with Google or create an account with email
3. You'll land on your dashboard

## Step 2: Choose a Plan

Video Recap AI is paid-only (no free trial). Choose a plan based on how many minutes you need per month:

| Plan | Monthly Minutes | Price |
|------|-----------------|-------|
| Creator | 60 min | $20/month |
| Studio | 180 min | $60/month |

**Minutes** = total output duration processed, not upload length. A 20-minute recap uses 20 minutes of your quota.

## Step 3: Upload Your First Video

1. From the dashboard, click **New Video**
2. Upload your source video (anime episode, movie file, etc.)
3. Enter a title for your project
4. Configure options:
   - **Copyright Protection**: Enable to apply safe-editing patterns
   - **Voice Style**: Choose the AI voice for narration
5. Click **Start Processing**

Processing time depends on video length. You'll see progress updates in real-time.

## Step 4: Review Output

When processing completes, you'll receive:

- **Recap Script** — Structured narrative text
- **Voiceover Audio** — AI-generated narration (downloadable)
- **Clip Map** — Timestamps mapping script segments to source video

Review the output, then export to your video editor for final assembly.

## Step 5: Export and Edit

Download the voiceover and clip map, then import into your editor (Premiere, DaVinci, CapCut, etc.):

1. Import your source video
2. Import the voiceover audio
3. Use the clip map to cut and arrange footage
4. Add your own polish (transitions, graphics, music)
5. Export and upload to your channel
