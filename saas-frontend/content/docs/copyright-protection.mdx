</Callout>

When you enable **Copyright Protection**, Video Recap AI automatically applies editing patterns designed to reduce the likelihood of copyright claims and blocks.

## How It Works

The system applies multiple layers of protection:

### 1. Clip Length Limits

Individual clips are kept short (typically under 10 seconds). Shorter clips are:

- Harder for fingerprinting systems to match confidently
- More clearly "transformative" (not just replaying the original)

### 2. Clip Spacing

Clips are spaced apart rather than played back-to-back from the same scene. This breaks up continuous sequences that detection systems look for.

### 3. Visual Transforms

Subtle visual changes are applied:

- **Zoom/crop** — Changes the frame composition
- **Color grading** — Shifts hue, saturation, or contrast
- **Speed adjustment** — Slight speedup or slowdown

These transforms alter the visual fingerprint while keeping content recognizable.

### 4. Audio Replacement

Original audio is replaced with the AI voiceover. Audio fingerprinting is often more sensitive than visual, so removing the original soundtrack significantly reduces match likelihood.

## What Gets Applied

When Copyright Protection is enabled:

| Pattern | Applied |
|---------|---------|
| Clip length limits | ✓ |
| Clip spacing | ✓ |
| Visual transforms | ✓ |
| Original audio removal | ✓ |

All patterns are applied **automatically** during processing. You receive output that's already optimized.

## Configuration Options

Currently, Copyright Protection is a single toggle (on/off). Future updates may include:

- Custom clip length limits
- Transform intensity settings
- Selective application per segment

## What This Doesn't Do

Copyright Protection is **not**:

- A legal guarantee against claims
- A substitute for fair use analysis
- A way to use content you don't have rights to

It's a set of **technical patterns** that reduce detection likelihood. Use responsibly and in accordance with copyright law.

## Best Practices

For maximum protection:

1. **Enable Copyright Protection** during processing
2. **Add your own commentary** — More original content = more transformative
3. **Use B-roll and graphics** — Break up source footage with your own elements
4. **Keep clips short** — Even shorter than the system's defaults if possible
5. **Monitor your uploads** — Track which videos get claims and adjust

## If You Get a Claim

Claims can still happen. If they do:

1. **Review the claim** — What content was matched?
2. **Consider disputing** — If you believe it's fair use
3. **Edit and re-upload** — Adjust the flagged sections
4. **Learn for next time** — Note what triggered the claim
