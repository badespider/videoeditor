description: What Video Recap AI generates — script, voiceover, and clip map explained.
---

When processing completes, Video Recap AI provides three main outputs. This guide explains what each contains and how to use them.

## 1. Recap Script

The **recap script** is a structured narrative that tells the story of your source video.

### Structure

The script is organized into segments:

- **Intro Hook** — A teaser line to grab attention
- **Introduction** — Context: what show/movie, where we are in the story
- **Act 1** — Setup and key events
- **Act 2** — Rising action and conflicts
- **Climax** — The turning point or major moment
- **Outro** — Wrap-up and call-to-action

### Format

Each segment includes:

```
[SEGMENT NAME]
Narration text goes here...

[NEXT SEGMENT]
More narration...
```

### Editing Tips

- The script is a **starting point** — refine it to match your voice
- Add your own commentary or reactions
- Adjust pacing for your target platform (YouTube vs. TikTok)

## 2. Voiceover Audio

The **voiceover** is AI-generated narration of the recap script.

### What You Get

- High-quality audio file (MP3 or WAV)
- Synced to the script segments
- Downloadable from the job details page

### Using the Voiceover

1. Import into your video editor
2. Place on your audio timeline
3. Align video clips to match narration timing

### Voice Options

Different AI voices are available. Choose based on:

- Tone (dramatic, casual, energetic)
- Gender preference
- Accent/style

## 3. Clip Map

The **clip map** shows which parts of the source video to use for each script segment.

### Format

A table mapping script segments to timestamps:

| Segment | Start Time | End Time | Duration |
|---------|------------|----------|----------|
| Intro Hook | 00:00:30 | 00:00:45 | 15s |
| Act 1 | 00:02:15 | 00:05:30 | 3m 15s |
| Act 2 | 00:08:00 | 00:12:45 | 4m 45s |
| Climax | 00:18:20 | 00:20:00 | 1m 40s |
| Outro | 00:21:30 | 00:22:00 | 30s |

### How to Use

1. Open your source video in your editor
2. Navigate to each timestamp
3. Cut the specified clip
4. Arrange clips in order on your timeline
5. Sync with voiceover

### Why It Helps

Instead of scrubbing through hours of footage, you have a **starting cut plan**. You're not searching—you're refining.
