description: How to upload and configure a video processing job in Video Recap AI.
---

This guide covers the upload process and configuration options for your video jobs.

## Supported Formats

Video Recap AI accepts common video formats:

- **MP4** (recommended)
- **MKV**
- **MOV**
- **AVI**
- **WEBM**

**Maximum file size**: 10 GB per upload

**Recommended resolution**: 720p or 1080p (higher resolutions work but increase processing time)

## Upload Steps

### 1. Start a New Job

From your dashboard, click **New Video** to open the upload form.

### 2. Select Your File

Drag and drop your video file or click to browse. Upload progress is shown in real-time.

### 3. Enter a Title

Give your project a descriptive name (e.g., "Attack on Titan S4E10 Recap"). This helps you identify jobs in your dashboard.

### 4. Configure Processing Options

**Copyright Protection** (optional)
- When enabled, the system applies safe-editing patterns:
  - Clip length limits
  - Visual transforms (zoom, color shift)
  - Spacing between clips
- Designed to reduce (not eliminate) copyright claim risk

**Voice Style**
- Choose from available AI voices
- Preview samples before selecting

**Output Language**
- Script and voiceover language (English by default)

### 5. Start Processing

Click **Start Processing** to begin. You'll see:

- Real-time progress bar
- Current processing step (transcription, script generation, voiceover, clip matching)
- Estimated time remaining

You can navigate away—processing continues in the background. You'll receive a notification when complete.

## Processing Time

Typical processing times:

| Video Length | Approx. Time |
|--------------|--------------|
| 20 min | 3-5 min |
| 45 min | 8-12 min |
| 90 min | 15-25 min |

Times vary based on server load and content complexity.

## Canceling a Job

You can cancel a job in progress from the job details page. Canceled jobs don't count against your monthly minutes.

## Troubleshooting

**Upload fails or stalls**
- Check your internet connection
- Try a smaller file or lower resolution
- Ensure the file isn't corrupted

**Processing stuck**
- Refresh the page to check actual status
- If stuck for 30+ minutes, contact support

**Unsupported format error**
- Convert your video to MP4 using a tool like HandBrake or FFmpeg
