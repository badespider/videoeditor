## General

### Who is Video Recap AI for?

Anime and movie recap creators who want to publish faster without burning out. If you're spending days on a single recap video, juggling scripting, clipping, and voiceover, this tool is for you.

### What do I get after uploading a video?

A recap-ready package:
- **Structured script** — Narrative broken into intro, acts, climax, outro
- **AI voiceover** — Narration audio synced to the script
- **Clip map** — Timestamps showing which parts of the source to use

### How long does processing take?

Typically 3-5 minutes for a 20-minute video, 15-25 minutes for a 90-minute movie. Times vary based on server load.

### What video formats are supported?

MP4, MKV, MOV, AVI, and WEBM. Maximum file size is 10 GB.

## Copyright

### Will this prevent copyright claims?

No tool can guarantee zero claims. Video Recap AI includes optional **copyright-safe editing patterns** (clip limits, transforms, audio replacement) designed to reduce risk, not eliminate it.

### What if I still get a claim?

Claims can happen. If they do:
1. Review what triggered the claim
2. Consider disputing if you believe it's fair use
3. Edit and re-upload with adjustments
4. Note patterns for future videos

### Is this legal?

Video Recap AI is a tool. How you use it determines legality. Review fair use guidelines and platform policies for your jurisdiction. We don't provide legal advice.

## Billing

### How do minutes work?

Minutes = total output duration processed. A 20-minute recap uses 20 minutes, regardless of source video length.

### Do unused minutes roll over?

**Plan minutes**: Reset each billing cycle (no rollover)
**Top-up credits**: Roll over indefinitely until used

### Can I cancel anytime?

Yes. Cancel from Billing → Manage Subscription. You keep access until the end of your current billing period.

### What payment methods do you accept?

Credit/debit cards (Visa, Mastercard, Amex) via Stripe.

## Technical

### Can I use this for languages other than English?

Currently, English is the primary supported language. More languages coming soon.

### What if processing fails?

Failed jobs don't count against your minutes. Contact support if issues persist.

### Can I download the output?

Yes. Script, voiceover, and clip map are all downloadable from the job details page.

### Do you store my source videos?

Source videos are stored temporarily for processing and deleted after 7 days. Output files are retained in your account.

---

## Workflow

### Do I still need a video editor?

Yes. Video Recap AI generates the script, voiceover, and clip map. You assemble the final video in your editor (Premiere, DaVinci, CapCut, etc.).

### Can I edit the script before generating voiceover?

Currently, script and voiceover are generated together. Future updates may allow script editing before voiceover generation.

### How is this different from ChatGPT + ElevenLabs + an editor?

Those tools are powerful, but you spend time stitching them together every episode. Video Recap AI is purpose-built for recap production: one upload → script + voiceover + clip map in a single pipeline.
