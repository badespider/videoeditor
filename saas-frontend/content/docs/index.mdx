**Video Recap AI** helps anime and movie recap creators publish faster by automating the most time-consuming parts of the workflow: scripting, voiceover, and clip matching.

## What You Get

When you upload an episode or movie, Video Recap AI generates:

1. **Structured Recap Script** — A narrative script broken into intro, acts, climax, and outro
2. **AI Voiceover** — Narration synced to your script
3. **Clip Map** — Suggested timestamps showing which parts of the source video to use for each script segment
4. **Copyright-Safe Edits** (optional) — Visual transforms and clip spacing to reduce claim risk

## Who It's For

- Anime recap YouTubers and TikTok creators
- Movie recap and "explained" channels
- Faceless editors who want a repeatable pipeline
- Solo creators and small teams who need speed without burnout
