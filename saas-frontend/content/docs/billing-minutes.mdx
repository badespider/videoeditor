title: Billing & Minutes
description: Understanding plans, minutes, usage, and top-ups in Video Recap AI.
---

Video Recap AI uses a **minutes-based billing** system. This guide explains how it works.

## Plans

| Plan | Monthly Minutes | Price |
|------|-----------------|-------|
| Creator | 60 min | $20/month |
| Studio | 180 min | $60/month |

Both plans include all features:
- AI script generation
- AI voiceover
- Clip mapping
- Copyright protection
- Priority support (Studio)

## What "Minutes" Means

**Minutes = total output duration processed**

If you process a video and generate a 15-minute recap, you use 15 minutes of your quota.

**Not** the length of your source video. A 2-hour movie that produces a 20-minute recap uses 20 minutes.

## Checking Your Usage

From your dashboard:

1. Go to **Billing**
2. See your current month's usage
3. View remaining minutes

The usage bar shows:
- Minutes used this month
- Plan allowance
- Top-up balance (if any)

## Top-Ups (Rollover Credits)

Need more minutes? Buy top-ups anytime:

| Top-Up | Minutes | Price |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Small | +60 min | $20 |
| Large | +120 min | $40 |

**Top-ups roll over** — unused minutes carry forward to future months until used.

### How Top-Ups Work

1. Your plan allowance is used first each month
2. When plan allowance is exhausted, top-up credits are consumed
3. Unused top-up credits persist indefinitely

### Example

- You have a Creator plan (60 min/month)
- You buy a +60 min top-up
- In January, you use 80 minutes:
  - 60 min from plan allowance
  - 20 min from top-up
- In February, you have:
  - 60 min plan allowance (reset)
  - 40 min remaining top-up credits

## Billing Cycle

- Plans renew monthly on your signup date
- Plan minutes reset each billing cycle
- Top-up credits never expire

## FAQ

**What happens if I run out of minutes?**

You can't start new jobs until you buy a top-up or your plan renews.

**Do unused plan minutes roll over?**

No. Plan minutes reset each billing cycle. Only top-up credits roll over.

**Can I get a refund?**

Contact support within 7 days of purchase for refund requests.
