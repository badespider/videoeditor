Consistency is the #1 factor for channel growth. But many recap creators burn out trying to keep up. Here's how to stay consistent without destroying yourself.

## The Consistency Trap

Big channels post daily. You see their output and think you need to match it.

**Reality check:**
- They have teams
- They've built systems over years
- They started small too

Comparing your Day 1 to their Year 5 is unfair and unproductive.

## Find Your Sustainable Pace

### Calculate Your Real Capacity

Track how long your current process takes:

| Task | Hours |
|------|-------|
| Watch source | 1 |
| Write script | 2 |
| Record/generate voiceover | 0.5 |
| Clip and edit | 3 |
| Thumbnail + upload | 0.5 |
| **Total** | **7 hours** |

Now ask: How many hours per week can you **realistically** dedicate?

- 7 hours/week = 1 video/week
- 14 hours/week = 2 videos/week

**Start with what's sustainable**, not what you wish you could do.

### Quality vs. Quantity

For new channels: **consistency beats quality**.

A "good enough" video every week beats a "perfect" video every month. You learn faster, get more feedback, and build momentum.

## Reduce Time Per Video

### Use Video Recap AI

The biggest time-saver. Instead of:
- 2 hours scripting → 10 minutes reviewing AI script
- 1 hour voiceover → Automatic
- 2 hours clipping → Clip map provided

**Net savings: 4+ hours per video**

### Template Everything

- Script structure (same format every time)
- Editing project (pre-built with graphics, audio tracks)
- Thumbnail template (swap image + text)
- Title/description formula

### Batch Process

Dedicate days to specific tasks:
- Monday: Watch + review scripts for 3 videos
- Tuesday: Edit all 3 videos
- Wednesday: Thumbnails + upload + schedule

Batching reduces context-switching and speeds you up.

## Build a Content Buffer

Never edit the video you're uploading today. Stay ahead.

**Target buffer: 2-4 videos**

Benefits:
- No panic if life happens
- Better editing (you're not rushed)
- Can skip a week without missing uploads

### How to Build a Buffer

1. Start with your normal pace
2. Add one extra video per week for a month
3. You now have a 4-video buffer
4. Maintain by staying one ahead

## Manage Energy, Not Just Time

### Identify Your Peak Hours

When are you most creative? Most focused?

- Script writing = high creativity (do during peak hours)
- Clipping = medium focus (do anytime)
- Uploading = low focus (do when tired)

Match tasks to energy levels.

### Take Real Breaks

Burnout comes from:
- No days off
- No separation between work and rest
- Constant guilt about not working

**Schedule rest like you schedule work.** One day per week with zero content work.

### Set Boundaries

- Define "done" before you start editing
- Set a hard stop time each day
- Don't check analytics obsessively

## When to Scale Up

Only increase output when:

1. Your current pace feels easy (not just manageable)
2. You have a buffer of 4+ videos
3. You've optimized your process
4. You have time to spare

Scaling too fast = burnout. Patience pays off.

## Recovery If You're Already Burned Out

1. **Take a real break** — 1-2 weeks off if needed
2. **Lower your pace** — Temporarily cut to 50% of previous output
3. **Simplify your process** — What can you cut or automate?
4. **Rebuild slowly** — Add back volume only when it feels sustainable

Your channel can survive a break. You can't create if you're fried.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Find your sustainable pace** — Not what others do
2. **Reduce time per video** — Automation + templates
3. **Build a buffer** — Never edit day-of
4. **Manage energy** — Match tasks to focus levels
5. **Scale slowly** — Only when current pace is easy

Consistency is a marathon. Pace yourself.
