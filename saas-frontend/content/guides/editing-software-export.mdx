Video Recap AI generates script, voiceover, and clip map. This guide shows how to use that output in popular video editors.

## What You're Working With

After processing, you have:

1. **Script** — Text file with structured narration
2. **Voiceover** — Audio file (MP3 or WAV)
3. **Clip Map** — Timestamps (CSV or table) mapping script to source video

Your job: assemble these in your editor.

## Adobe Premiere Pro

### Setup

1. Create a new project
2. Import your source video
3. Import the voiceover audio
4. Open the clip map for reference

### Workflow

1. **Place voiceover on audio track**
   - Drag voiceover to A1
   - This is your timeline backbone

2. **Mark script segments**
   - Use markers (M key) to note where each script segment starts
   - Label markers: "Intro", "Act 1", etc.

3. **Cut source video**
   - Open source video in Source Monitor
   - Use clip map timestamps to set In (I) and Out (O) points
   - Insert clips to timeline (,) or overwrite (.)

4. **Align clips to voiceover**
   - Match video cuts to narration timing
   - Use Slip tool (Y) to adjust clip content without moving position

5. **Add transitions and graphics**
   - Cross dissolves between scenes
   - Text overlays for context
   - Your intro/outro graphics

### Tips

- Use Pancake Timeline (stacked sequences) for complex edits
- Create a project template with audio tracks pre-configured
- Use Essential Graphics for reusable text templates

## DaVinci Resolve

### Setup

1. Create a new project
2. Import media to Media Pool
3. Create a timeline

### Workflow

1. **Add voiceover**
   - Drag voiceover to Audio 1
   - Enable waveform display for visual reference

2. **Use clip map**
   - Open clip map in a text editor or spreadsheet
   - Note timestamps for each segment

3. **Cut source video**
   - In Cut page: use Source Tape mode to scrub source
   - Set In/Out points and add to timeline
   - Or use Edit page for more control

4. **Sync to voiceover**
   - Align video clips to narration
   - Use Trim Edit mode (T) for precise adjustments

5. **Color and effects**
   - Apply color grade in Color page
   - Add transitions in Edit page

### Tips

- Use Power Bins for frequently used assets
- Create a template project with your standard setup
- Use Smart Bins to organize clips by metadata

## CapCut (Desktop)

### Setup

1. Create a new project
2. Import source video and voiceover
3. Have clip map open for reference

### Workflow

1. **Add voiceover**
   - Drag to audio track
   - This sets your timing

2. **Split and arrange source video**
   - Add source video to video track
   - Use Split (Ctrl/Cmd+B) at clip map timestamps
   - Delete unwanted sections

3. **Reorder clips**
   - Drag clips to match script segment order
   - Align with voiceover timing

4. **Add effects**
   - Apply transitions between clips
   - Add text overlays
   - Use CapCut's auto-captions if needed

### Tips

- Use keyboard shortcuts for faster editing
- Save custom presets for effects you use often
- Export at 1080p for YouTube, vertical for TikTok/Reels

## CapCut (Mobile)

### Workflow

1. Import source video and voiceover to your phone
2. Create new project in CapCut
3. Add voiceover as audio track
4. Split source video at key timestamps
5. Rearrange clips to match narration
6. Add text, transitions, effects
7. Export and upload

### Tips

- Use the "Extract Audio" feature if you need to separate tracks
- Save templates for consistent style
- Export in highest quality your phone supports

## Final Cut Pro

### Setup

1. Create a new library and project
2. Import source video and voiceover
3. Set project settings to match source

### Workflow

1. **Add voiceover to timeline**
   - Drag to audio lane
   - Use audio waveform for visual timing

2. **Use clip map**
   - Reference timestamps as you work
   - Use Range tool (R) to select portions of source

3. **Add clips**
   - Set In (I) and Out (O) in source
   - Append (E) or Insert (W) to timeline

4. **Adjust timing**
   - Use Trim tool (T) to adjust edits
   - Slip clips to change content without moving position

5. **Finish**
   - Add transitions (Cmd+T for default)
   - Apply color correction
   - Add titles and graphics

### Tips

- Use Compound Clips to group related clips
- Create Motion templates for reusable graphics
- Use Roles for organized audio management

## General Tips (All Editors)

### Organize Your Project

```
Project Folder/
  Source/
    episode.mp4
  Audio/
    voiceover.mp3
  Assets/
    intro.mp4
    outro.mp4
    graphics/
  Exports/
```

### Use the Clip Map Efficiently

Print it or keep it on a second monitor. Check off segments as you complete them.

### Save Incrementally

Save versions as you work:
- `project_v1.prproj`
- `project_v2.prproj`
- `project_final.prproj`

### Export Settings

For YouTube:
- H.264 codec
- 1080p or 4K
- 15-30 Mbps bitrate
- AAC audio at 320 kbps

For TikTok/Reels:
- 9:16 vertical
- 1080x1920
- Under 3 minutes

## Troubleshooting

**Audio out of sync**
- Check source video frame rate matches project
- Re-import voiceover if needed

**Clips don't match timestamps**
- Verify you're using the correct source file
- Check if source has been trimmed

**Export quality is poor**
- Increase bitrate
- Use a higher quality codec
- Check export resolution matches source
