Once you've got the basics down, these advanced tips will help you produce recaps faster while maintaining quality.

## Batch Your Work

The biggest time-saver is **batching similar tasks**:

- **Script day**: Write or review scripts for 3-4 episodes
- **Voiceover day**: Generate or record all voiceovers
- **Clipping day**: Pull clips for multiple videos
- **Edit day**: Assemble and polish

Context-switching kills productivity. Staying in "mode" lets you move faster.

## Create Templates

Don't start from scratch. Build templates for:

### Script Template
```
[HOOK - 10 sec]
One-sentence teaser about the biggest moment.

[INTRO - 20 sec]
Context: show name, where we are in the story.

[ACT 1 - 2 min]
Key setup and events.

[ACT 2 - 3 min]
Rising action and conflicts.

[CLIMAX - 2 min]
The turning point.

[OUTRO - 30 sec]
Wrap-up + CTA.
```

### Editing Template
Create a project template in your editor with:
- Standard intro/outro graphics
- Preset color grades
- Audio tracks pre-configured
- Common transitions saved

## Build a Clip Library

For recurring shows, maintain a **clip library**:

- Character introduction shots
- Location establishing shots
- Reaction faces
- Key emotional moments
- Transition clips

When you need a cutaway, you're grabbing from your library—not scrubbing through episodes.

## Use Keyboard Shortcuts

Learn shortcuts for your editor:

| Action | Premiere | DaVinci | CapCut |
|--------|----------|---------|--------|
| Cut | Cmd/Ctrl+K | Cmd/Ctrl+B | Cmd/Ctrl+B |
| Ripple delete | Shift+Delete | Delete | Delete |
| Add marker | M | M | M |

Shaving seconds per action adds up to hours over a project.

## Optimize Your Preview Settings

When editing:
- Use 1/4 or 1/2 resolution previews
- Disable effects during rough cut
- Only render at full quality for export

This keeps your timeline responsive during editing.

## Set Time Limits

Perfectionism kills productivity. Set limits:

- **Rough cut**: 1 hour max
- **Fine cut**: 30 minutes
- **Polish**: 30 minutes
- **Export + upload**: 30 minutes

A "good enough" video published beats a perfect video stuck in editing.

## Leverage Video Recap AI

Let the tool handle the tedious parts:

1. **Script generation** — Get a structured starting point
2. **Voiceover** — No recording or syncing
3. **Clip map** — Know exactly where to cut

Your job becomes **refinement**, not creation from scratch.

## Track What Works

Keep a simple log:

| Video | Views | Watch Time | Notes |
|-------|-------|------------|-------|
| AOT S4E10 | 50K | 8 min | Strong hook, slow Act 2 |
| JJK S2E5 | 80K | 10 min | Climax pacing perfect |

Patterns emerge. Double down on what works.

## Automate the Boring Stuff

Automate where possible:

- **Thumbnails**: Use templates with swappable elements
- **Titles/descriptions**: Keep a formula, just update details
- **Tags**: Maintain a master list per show
- **Scheduling**: Batch upload and schedule releases

## Key Takeaways

1. **Batch** similar tasks together
2. **Template** everything you repeat
3. **Library** clips for quick access
4. **Limit** time spent on each phase
5. **Track** results to improve

Speed comes from systems, not working harder.
