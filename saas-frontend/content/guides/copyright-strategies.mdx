Copyright claims are a constant challenge for recap creators. This guide covers strategies beyond the basics.

## Understanding Detection Systems

Content ID and similar systems use:

1. **Audio fingerprinting** — Matching audio waveforms
2. **Visual fingerprinting** — Matching video frames
3. **Metadata matching** — Title, description keywords

Each has different sensitivities and bypass strategies.

## Audio Strategies

Audio fingerprinting is often **more sensitive** than visual. Prioritize audio changes.

### Remove Original Audio Entirely

The most effective strategy. Replace with:
- AI voiceover (Video Recap AI)
- Your own narration
- Royalty-free music

### If Using Original Audio

- Keep clips under 5 seconds
- Add voice overlay throughout
- Pitch shift slightly (not too much or it sounds bad)
- Add background music to mask

## Visual Strategies

Visual fingerprinting looks for frame sequences. Break them up.

### Clip Length

| Length | Risk Level |
|--------|------------|
| < 5 sec | Low |
| 5-10 sec | Medium |
| 10-30 sec | High |
| > 30 sec | Very High |

Shorter is better. Under 10 seconds is a good target.

### Spacing

Don't play clips back-to-back from the same scene. Interleave with:
- Narration cards
- Graphics/text
- Different scenes
- B-roll

### Visual Transforms

Apply subtle changes:

**Zoom/crop** — 10-20% zoom changes the frame
**Mirror** — Horizontal flip (use sparingly, it's obvious)
**Color grade** — Shift hue, increase/decrease saturation
**Speed** — 1.05x or 0.95x (subtle, not noticeable)
**Overlay** — Borders, vignettes, watermarks

**Layering matters.** One transform alone is weak. Combine 2-3 for better protection.

### Picture-in-Picture

Show clips in a smaller frame with:
- Your face cam
- Graphics around the clip
- Commentary text

This clearly signals "reaction/commentary" rather than "replay."

## Content Strategies

Beyond technical edits, your **content approach** matters.

### Add Original Commentary

The more you add, the more "transformative" your video becomes:
- Analysis and opinions
- Comparisons to other shows
- Predictions and theories
- Behind-the-scenes context

### Use Your Own Assets

Mix source footage with:
- Custom graphics
- Your own animations
- Stock footage
- Fan art (with permission)

### Structure as Commentary

Frame your video as commentary, not summary:
- "Here's why this scene matters..."
- "Notice how the director chose to..."
- "This parallels the manga's approach..."

## Platform-Specific Tips

### YouTube

- Content ID is aggressive
- Disputes can take weeks
- Consider revenue sharing if you can't avoid claims

### TikTok

- Less aggressive detection
- But still happens
- Shorter clips naturally help

### Instagram Reels

- Similar to TikTok
- Audio matching is common
- Use trending sounds as cover

## When Claims Happen

1. **Don't panic** — Claims aren't strikes
2. **Review the match** — What triggered it?
3. **Decide: dispute or accept**
   - Dispute if you believe it's fair use
   - Accept if you just want monetization (revenue share)
4. **Learn for next time** — Adjust your approach

## Video Recap AI's Protection

When enabled, Copyright Protection applies:
- Clip length limits
- Automatic spacing
- Visual transforms
- Audio replacement with voiceover

This gives you a **protected starting point**. You can add more layers in your editor.

## Summary Checklist

Before uploading, verify:

- [ ] Original audio removed or heavily modified
- [ ] No clips over 10 seconds
- [ ] Clips spaced with narration/graphics
- [ ] Visual transforms applied
- [ ] Original commentary throughout
- [ ] Mix of source + original assets

No guarantee, but this significantly reduces risk.
