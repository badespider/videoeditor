  This guide walks through a repeatable pipeline for anime and movie recap
  creators. Whether you post on YouTube, TikTok, or Shorts, the workflow stays
  the same.
</Callout>

If you're making recap videos, you've probably felt the pain of starting from scratch every time. New episode drops, and suddenly you're juggling scripting, clipping, voiceover, and editing—all over again.

The solution isn't working harder. It's building a **repeatable pipeline** you can run on every episode.

## The 4-Stage Recap Pipeline

### 1. Ingest: Drop the Episode

Start by uploading or importing your source video. The goal here is to have one canonical file you'll reference throughout the process.

**Tips:**
- Use consistent naming: `[Show]_S01E05.mp4`
- Store in a dedicated folder per project
- Note the episode runtime for planning

### 2. Script: Generate a Structured Recap

Instead of writing freeform, create a **structured recap script** with clear segments:

- **Intro hook** (5–10 seconds)
- **Act 1 summary** (key setup)
- **Act 2 summary** (rising action)
- **Climax** (turning point)
- **Outro + CTA**

AI tools can help generate a first draft. You then refine it to match your voice and style.

**Why structure matters:**
- Easier to match clips to script segments
- Consistent pacing across episodes
- Faster editing decisions

### 3. Voiceover: Record or Generate

Once your script is locked, generate or record the voiceover.

**Options:**
- AI voiceover (ElevenLabs, Play.ht, etc.)
- Self-recorded narration
- Hybrid (AI for drafts, re-record key lines)

**Pro tip:** Export voiceover as separate segments aligned to your script structure. This makes clip matching much easier.

### 4. Clip Map: Match Clips to Script

For each script segment, identify which parts of the episode to use.

A **clip map** looks like this:

| Script Segment | Episode Timestamp | Duration |
|----------------|-------------------|----------|
| Intro hook     | 00:00–00:45       | 10s      |
| Act 1 summary  | 02:30–05:00       | 45s      |
| Act 2 summary  | 08:00–12:30       | 60s      |
| Climax         | 18:00–20:00       | 40s      |
| Outro          | 21:30–22:00       | 15s      |

With a clip map, you're not randomly scrubbing through footage. You have a plan.

## Automating the Pipeline

Manual clip mapping works, but it's slow. Tools like **Video Recap AI** automate the heavy lifting:

1. Upload your episode
2. Get a structured script + voiceover
3. Receive a suggested clip map
4. Export to your editor and refine

The goal isn't to remove your creative input—it's to handle the repetitive parts so you can focus on storytelling.

## Why Repeatability Matters

Recap creators who post consistently often burn out because every video feels like starting over.

A repeatable pipeline means:
- **Faster turnaround** (hours, not days)
- **Consistent quality** (same structure, same pacing)
- **Less decision fatigue** (the process guides you)

Whether you're covering anime, movies, or TV shows, the workflow stays the same. Only the content changes.

## Next Steps

1. **Map your current process** — Where do you spend the most time?
2. **Identify bottlenecks** — Scripting? Clipping? Voiceover sync?
3. **Test automation** — Try Video Recap AI to see how much time you save

The best recap creators aren't the ones who work the hardest. They're the ones who've built systems that let them ship consistently without burning out.
